# SM3DWFRPG
A Super Minimal 3D Wireframe Renderer in Pygame

## About

I wrote this renderer to visualise my [Pi-day contribution](https://github.com/OsiPog/pi-cube-sphere) 2022. It is capable of drawing the wireframe versions of cubes and spheres such as points. The primitives cube and sphere can be rotated around the y-axis.

## Installation

Download "SM3DWFRPG.py" and add it to your project or add this repo as a dependency. It is recommended to import it using `from SM3DWFRPG import *` as it a very small renderer which will not litter your project with functions and classes as it only consists of two classes. If you insist on importing it as a package I recommend you to use `import SM3DWFRPG as mwfr`
